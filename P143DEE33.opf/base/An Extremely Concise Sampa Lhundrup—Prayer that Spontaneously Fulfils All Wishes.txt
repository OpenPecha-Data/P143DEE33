An Extremely Concise Sampa Lhundrup
by Tertön Rangrik Dorje

gyal kün ngowo chimé tötreng tsal
Lifeblood of all Victors, immortal Tötreng Tsal –
solwa deb so tukjé chen gyi zik
I pray to you! Please care for me with your love!
nedön gek tsok barché ying su sol
Dispel all obstacles – disease, harm, and hindrances – into space!
sampa lhün gyi drubpar jingyi lob
Grant your blessings so that all my wishes may be spontaneously fulfilled!
om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra-guru-padma-siddhi hūṃ
