The Spontaneous Fulfilment of All Wishes
Invoking the Great Guru of Uḍḍiyāna
by Tertön Rangrik Dorje

kyema kyé hü künkhyen pema jung
Kyema Kyehü! All-knowing Padmākara,
tukjé zik shik ngayab lingpa khyen
Father Ngayab Lingpa, care for me!
ta shyi tsön kha bö kham dang la nyé
When Tibet’s borders are at war and hostility is near,
gyalten nyima nub rir jön la ché
When the Victors’ teachings are disappearing like the sun passing over the mountains,
bö kham jelön dukngal nyen tsang nar
When Tibet’s king and ministers are in torment, worn down by suffering –
gön khyö ngön gyi tukdam shyalshyé shyin
Then for these, your disciples of this Snowy Land,
dulja chi dang khyepar gangjong dir
Padmākara, my protector, in accordance with your promise,
ta shyi makpung né tsön mugé dang
Swiftly avert, without exception,
jikpa gyé sok tenjung gyundré kyi
Invading armies, disease, war, famine, the eight fears,
düpé mitün gal jé barché rik
All obstacles, hindrances and adverse circumstance —
malü nyurdu dok chik pema jung
Products of the law of cause and effect.
gyalten dargyé der dzin kha dang nyam
May the Victors’ teachings and those that hold, expand and share them be as widespread as the
sky!
shedrub dütsi dro kham rab min né
May sentient beings develop and mature, through the nectar of your teachings and practices!
dön nyi lhün gyi drubpar dzé du sol
Thus may we spontaneously accomplish the twofold benefit!
om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra-guru-padma-siddhi hūṃ

This Guru Rinpoche invocation, particularly fitting for these times, was composed by Rangrik
Dorjé at the request of government officials. Jayantu!
