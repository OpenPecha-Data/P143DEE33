An Extremely Concise Barché Lamsel
by Tertön Rangrik Dorje

kyabné kündü orgyen rinpoche
Embodiment of all sources of refuge, precious Guru of Uḍḍiyāna:
zömé dungshuk drakpö solwa deb
With intense devotion that rends my heart, I pray to you!
chi nang sangwé galkyen barché sel
Dispel all obstacles and adversities—outer, inner and secret!
chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsal du sol
Please grant us accomplishments—ordinary and supreme!
om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra-guru-padma-siddhi hūṃ
