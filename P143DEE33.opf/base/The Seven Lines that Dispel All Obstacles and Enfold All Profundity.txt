by Tertön Rangrik Dorje

jinlab kün tsol lama pema jung
Bestower of all blessings, the Lotus-Born, Padmākara;
ngödrub kün dak yidam tachok pal
Lord of all accomplishments, the iṣṭadevatā, mighty Hayagrīva;
trinlé kün ter khandro naljorma
Fulfiller of all activities, the ḍākinī Vajrayoginī1;
barché kün sel kasung chamdral dé
Dispeller of all obstacles, the guardians, male and female;
solwa deb so barché kün sol lo
To you we pray. Dispel all our obstacles!
sampé dön kün yishyin drubpa dang
Accomplish all our wishes, just as we desire!
tral puk küntu gelek char du nyil
Let virtue and goodness rain upon us, now and forever!
om ah hung guru dewa dakini dharmapala sarva siddhi hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ guru deva ḍākinī dharmapāla sarva-siddhi hūṃ

This profound key-point distills the extensive meaning, extraordinary and exalted, and is a
practice for the fortunate ones. It was spontaneously written down by Rigpe Dorje.
